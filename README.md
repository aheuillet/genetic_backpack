# genetic_knapsack

0-1 knapsack problem solver implemented using genetic algorithms and `Python 3`

To start the program, just use :

```bash
python3 knapsack.py
```

Optionally, you can use it through a GUI, but you will need `PySimpleGui`.
To install it on Debian-based systems, just do:

```bash
sudo pip3 install pysimplegui
```

Then you can start it with:

```bash
python3 gui.py
```
